Hi!

I am Chethan Palakshamurthy. I ðŸ’› building software.

I intend to share my notes, my work (designs that have worked well), bits of knowledge, and perspectives here.

I hope you find them useful and interesting.

Outside of work, I love poetry. I write in Kannada [here](http://pada-naalku-saalaagi.blogspot.com/).
